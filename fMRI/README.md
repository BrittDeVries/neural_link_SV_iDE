# fMRI analyses

The bash scripts mostly make calls to FSL 5.0.9 or other bash scripts in the repository. They were run on a high performance computing cluster called Myriad, at University College London (UCL), which required '#$' at the beginning of the script for commands sent to the scheduler. Some of the python scripts may have bash commands for the cluster at the top; it is safe to comment those out. The script order text file gives an overall idea of the pipeline. For example apply_brain_msk.sh and get_confounds.sh/get_confounds.py only needed to be run once. The other bash scripts needed to be run for every new GLM model. Some scripts explore BIC comparisons of said models but were not used for any of the main analyses in the study.
