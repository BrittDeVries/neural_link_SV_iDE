Thresholded Z Map for Hypothesis 1
Parametric effect of gain: Positive effect in ventromedial PFC - for the equal indifference group

Parametric effect of gain: Positive effect in ventral striatum - for the equal indifference group

Parametric effect of loss: Negative effect in VMPFC - for the equal indifference group

Parametric effect of loss: Negative effect in VMPFC - for the equal range group

Parametric effect of loss: Positive effect in amygdala - for the equal indifference group

Parametric effect of loss: Positive effect in amygdala - for the equal range group

Equal range vs. equal indifference: Greater positive response to losses in amygdala for equal range condition vs. equal indifference condition.
(Equal Range greater than Equal Indifference)

Equal range vs. equal indifference: Greater positive response to losses in amygdala for equal range condition vs. equal indifference condition.
(Equal Indifference greater than Equal Range)
